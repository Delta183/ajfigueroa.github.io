title: About Me
---

My name is Alex Figueroa and I'm a Canadian Software Developer from Toronto, ON.

I am currently working @ [Kinetic Cafe](http://kineticcafe.com/) and any opinions made here are completely my own (that should go without saying).

Outside of programming, I'm really into sketching, playing guitar, and taking photographs of food or the outdoors.
I'll be adding more here as I build this through.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) or [Github](https://www.github.com/{{ site.github_username }}).
