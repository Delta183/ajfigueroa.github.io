My name is Alex and I'm an iOS Engineer from Toronto, ON.

Any opinions made here are completely my own.

Outside of programming, I'm enjoy reading, playing guitar, and taking photos.

Check out my photographs on [500px](https://500px.com/{{site.author.five_hundred_username}}) and feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter_username }}).
